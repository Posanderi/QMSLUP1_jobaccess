    "## Analysing the correlation between accessibility of jobs and unemployment in the capital region of Finland\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook was produced for analysing the correlation between job accessibility and unemployment between different YKR grid cells (250x250m resolution) located in the Finnish capital region. The used data are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- YKR demographic data from the year 2020 (SYKE, 2020: https://www.stat.fi/tup/ykraineistot/index.html):  YKR grids in the Helsinki region area, where there is at least a single person living within a cell. The data also contains various demographic information like the gender, income, employment status etc. of the inhabitants\n",
    "    - This data is used to extract the number of employed and unemployed people residing in the grid cell and further the unemployment rate\n",
    "    - Due to privacy reasons, in cells with too few people the number of employed and unemployed people are not told and marked with -1. These are filtered out\n",
    "    - Unemployment rate has already been calculated beforehand by dividing the number of unemployed people with the number of both employed and unemployed people in each cell to a new column (\"tyott\")\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data on the number of people employed in companies located within each grid cell (HSY, 2015: https://hri.fi/data/en_GB/dataset/helsingin-seudun-tyopaikkaruudukko) \n",
    "    - The data contains only private companies and non-public organisations\n",
    "    - This dataset has already been combined to the demographic data beforehand\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Helsinki travel time matrix (Digital Geography Lab, 2018: https://blogs.helsinki.fi/accessibility/helsinki-region-travel-time-matrix-2018/)\n",
    "    - Data on the estimated travel time to each YKR-grid cell from all the other grid cells in the capital region area. The dataset contains travel times of various different kinds of tranport modes and conditions, from which the following travel time metrics were chosen for analysis:\n",
    "        - Travel times by walking (70 meters/minute)\n",
    "        - Travel times by cycling (12km/hour). THe time also includes one minute extra for picking up and returning the bike\n",
    "        - Travel times by public transportation (rush hour, includes the whole travel chain liek for example waiting at home and at the station\n",
    "        - Travel times by car (rush hour, includes time for walking to the car, and finding a slot for parking)\n",
    "    - The data is provided in separate text files for each grid cell, which contains the travel times to each other grid cells in the area using different transportation modes\n",
    "\n",
    "Workflow for the data processing is following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Loop over the travel time matrix files and do the following:\n",
    "    - Only read the file if the grid cell ID is found in the YKR grid\n",
    "    - Join the travel time data with the dataframe on job and population in each grid cell\n",
    "    - Do the following:\n",
    "       - Calculate the average travel time to all the jobs in the Helsinki region for each transport mode for each cell to a new column\n",
    "       - Calculate the number of jobs within 30 minutes (the average travel time to work in the capital region) for each transport mode and for each cell to a new column\n",
    "- Join this data to the population YKR-grid cell by cell and save the dataframe with new columns included\n",
    "- Create correlation graphs showing the unemployment and job access in their own axes\n",
